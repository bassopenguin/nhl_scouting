# nhl_scouting

## Background

While playing NHL 19 Franchise mode, I created a new team and was excited by the new scouting mechanics.
However, that led me to consider how I could optimize my scouting.
For a long time now, I've wanted to explore GraphQL and this seems like a good excuse to do both!

## Description

This project will create a database schema of Players and Scouts and use GraphQL (and probably React on the front-end) to manage scout assignments.
The vision is that this database would hold information about scouting accuracy and allow the best performance in the draft by having complete scouting reports for the most players.
